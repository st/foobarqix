# foobarqix

_[http://www.code-story.net/](http://www.code-story.net/) presents a little challenge called foobarqix. It's the first phase to select a pair of programmers that will be part of the team led by David and Jean-Laurent at devoxx (april 2012)._
;; The following code is not a submission.
;; Instead a clojure solution (from an apprentice) written with simplicity in mind. I hope it may teach a little to newbies.
;; Feedbacks very welcome.

## Usage

`lein test` to execute the tests.
